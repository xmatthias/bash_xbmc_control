# bash_xbmc_control
Control remote xbmc-center with bash

A Very simple script to control my xbmc running on a raspberry pi from bash using simple keystroaks to pause/resume as my bluetooth-keyboard goes to sleep way too fast

symlink it in your bin-folder using "ln -s PathToRepo/xbmcControl.sh ~/bin/xbmcccontrol" to have it available from everywhere
